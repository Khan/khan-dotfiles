# Khan Academy specific .bash_profile

# The difference between .bash_profile and .profile is that the latter
# is called for all sh-compatible shells.  So we put bashisms here
# and non-bashisms in .profile.
#
# According to the bash manpage, if both .bash_profile and .profile
# exist, bash only reads the first one.  So we have to source .profile
# manually.

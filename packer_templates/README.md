# Packer Templates

## Overview

We are using [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) to build
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) development boxes.

See readme files for each box.

## Attribution

These templates started from [Bento](https://github.com/chef/bento) templates.
I started with these only because some things changed in ubuntu 20.04.1 initial
auth that these templates addressed. They were also decently developed packer
templates.

as of web 14 may 2014, this is purely optional and probably only
necessary if you are you testing ssl connections or want to use a
vhost like stable.ka.local

see http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpSslModule and copy the local.crt/key
files to the path below in ssl_certificate and ssl_certificate_key

you'll need to update /etc/hosts to have the following lines

    KA local servers
    127.0.0.1       exercises.ka.local
    ::1             exercises.ka.local
    127.0.0.1       stable.ka.local
    ::1             stable.ka.local

on a mac, you need to update the launchd script to run nginx as root

        #Copy the launch plist.
    sudo cp -f /usr/local/Cellar/nginx/*/homebrew.mxcl.nginx.plist \
        /Library/LaunchDaemons
    # Delete the username key so it is run as root
    sudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Delete :UserName" \
        /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.nginx.plist 2>/dev/null
    # Load it.
    sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.nginx.plist
